      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello. I'm currently a Computer Science major at Rutgers University. I've
        loved programming since I built my first computer in High School, and am just
        really excited to get into it as my career!</p>
      <p>Currently I'm a sophomore (graduating next spring, though) in college,
        so the only languages
        I'm really familiar with at the moment are Python, HTML, CSS, Java and C.
        All of my computers are running some form of Linux (best OS) - Debian on my laptop
        and desktop, Raspbian on both of my raspberry pi's, and Fedora
        as a secondary OS on my desktop. As I mentioned earlier, my desktop is custom
        built. Originally it was built for gaming, but it's turned into a developer
        system.</p>
      <p>Another aspect of my life that has been a heavy influence on me is my
        disability. And no it's not anything mental (I get that question just about
        everytime I explain this). The disability is called Charcot-Marie Tooth Disease and
        it basically destroys my feet. I've always been really bad at explaining it,
        so I'd suggest a quick google search if you want to learn more. But to
        explain how it affected me, I've had <strong>7 surgeries</strong>(5 on my
        feet and 2 on my back for scoliosis which happens to come with it :sadface:)
        throughout high school to prevent losing my ability to walk entirely. Even
        after all the work I've had done on my feet, they still get worse every day
        and I have to rely on leg braces just to be able to walk outside of the
        confines of my home.</p>
      <p>Now that I've made it through those surgeries, I really just want to do
        work. Getting through high school with 7 surgeries made me tremendously
        stronger as a person, and now I'm left with a huge drive to get work done.
      </p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>PyRatNews is intended to be an application that checks a given article
            for credibility. It checks the domain name, how many citations are given
            in the article, and track record of the author and publisher.</p>
          <p>This was by far the most enjoyable project I've worked on thus far.
            The project was created at Philly Codefest 2017 with myself and 3 other
            students, 2 of whom I've never met before. I personally worked on the
            web scraping - getting the domain name, finding the author and finding
            any citations in the article. The final product unfortunately doesn't work
            at the moment, but it was a pleasure to work on and I'm looking forward
            to my next hackathon!</p>
          <p>My contributions to this project were written in Python 3 using the
            <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4">Beautiful Soup 4</a>
            and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newspaper">Newspaper</a> libraries.</p>

          <p>This bot manages the roles on a Discord Server. For those who don't
            know, Discord is an app that allows people from all over the world to
            talk with eachother either through voice or text chats. This bot scans
            the text channels on a discord server for certain messages, and acts
            on those messages accordingly. For instance, the '!member' command gives
            the message sender the 'member' role on the server they sent the message
            in, if they meet certain criteria.</p>
          <p>I actually learned a ton from the creation of this bot, it's really
            the first project I've worked on where I dove deep into api documentation,
            so I attribute my doc-reading skills to this project alone. Not only
            did I have to learn how to read the docs, but I also had my first
            exposure to coroutines.</p>
          <p>This project was made in Python 3 using the <a href='https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py'>
            Discord.py API</a> and the <a href='https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia'>
            Cassiopeia Riot Games API</a>.</p>

          <p>I imagine you know what Pong is, but in case you don't, here's a
            brief explanation:</p>
          <p>Pong is a simple game where 2 players take control of a paddle and
            have the goal of scoring a ball into the opposing players goal. The
            winner is whoever has the most points at the end of the game.</p>
          <p>This was essentially my first <em>big</em> project. It's the first
            project I made that surpassed 100 lines <em>*claps*</em>. Being my first
            "big" project, this was definitely the project that I learned the most
            from. Unfortunately I made this project before I understood object
            oriented programming and at a point where I was unaware that I could
            just draw rectangles on the screen, so it definitely isn't the best
            work I've ever done. But it was my first project and I'll be revisiting it
            soon.</p>
          <p>This was written in Python 3 using the <a href='https://www.pygame.org/news'>
          PyGame</a> library.</p>
